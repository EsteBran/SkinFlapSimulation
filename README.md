# SkinFlapSimulation

## Usage & Installation

## To Do

- [ ] Refactor program into a more modular version in order to be able to add more features
- - [x] Make it use 3D coordinates instead of 2D
- [ ] Interacting between mesh and particles
- [x] Be able to import custom objects/meshes (obj files)
- [ ] Maybe using unity particle system
- [x] Move simulation into 3D (might have to start with 3D depending on what we want to do)
- [ ] Use shaders to parallelize simulation
- [x] Cut with laser and then maybe knife
- [ ] Figure out global position of particle
- [x] Cut objects into smaller objects and have them interact with one another real time 
- [ ] Mouse interaction

- [x] Better mouse interaction or cut with laser?
- [ ] Use knife to cut (probably use particles) using predetermined paths?
- - [ ] Probably need to create a system that simulates multiple objects
- [x] Try it out in 3D (have an idea of how much work we need to do)
- [ ] Refactor program into something more modular
