# SkinFlapSimulation

## Usage & Installation
This simulation runs on Unity 2020.3.14f1. It probably works on older versions and newer versions, but we can't guarantee that it'll work.

In order to run the sumulation on your machine, run '''git clone https://github.com/EsteBran/SkinFlapSimulation.git'''
## To Do

- [ ] Refactor program into a more modular version in order to be able to add more features
- - [x] Make it use 3D coordinates instead of 2D
- [ ] Interacting between mesh and particles
- [x] Be able to import custom objects/meshes (obj files)
- [ ] Maybe using unity particle system
- [x] Move simulation into 3D (might have to start with 3D depending on what we want to do)
- [ ] Use shaders to parallelize simulation
- [x] Cut with laser and then maybe knife
- [ ] Figure out global position of particle
- [x] Cut objects into smaller objects and have them interact with one another real time 
- [ ] Mouse interaction

- [x] Better mouse interaction or cut with laser?
- [ ] Use knife to cut (probably use particles) using predetermined paths?
- - [ ] Probably need to create a system that simulates multiple objects
- [x] Try it out in 3D (have an idea of how much work we need to do)
- [ ] Refactor program into something more modular
